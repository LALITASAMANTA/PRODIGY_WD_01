            Welcome to Bridal Wedding Collections..Where Scope out the wedding venue online.
            Is the space modern, trendy, vintage, or quirky? These are all cues that will help you
            understand the couple's vision for their wedding day, as well as what fashion might be appropriate.
            Here's an example: the couple is getting married at the newest sleek event space in town, with
            rooftop cocktails and no children in attendance. These are all hints that this is a dressy or formal affair.
            <br><br>
            Also, consider the time of day and location. Afternoon weddings and events with earlier
            curfews will naturally be more casual, while evening weddings are more formal.
            The same goes for a backyard wedding versus an indoor wedding in a banquet hall.
            Will the reception be moving to another swanky location? If so, it may be a fancier event
            afterparty and you'll want to be dressed appropriately..
            <br><br>
            In the past decade, weddings—and wedding fashion—embraced themes like never before.
            Rustic barn, boho, garden, Italian villa and high-fashion, diamond-encrusted affairs
            like reality star Kandi Burruss's, pictured here, are just a few examples of
            how modern couples are making their mark on wedding history. It's no coincidence
            that wedding style took to new heights during the first decade with social media,
            when weddings are being photographed (or in Kandi's case, televised and then meme-ified!)
            more than they ever have.
            <br><br>
            While the concept of marriage dates to ancient civilizations such as Sumer, Babylon, and Assyria,
            the idea of weddings being a romantic affair is more recent. Historical analysis of paintings
            featuring Assyrian artifacts, including Edwin Long's 1875 interpretation, suggests that women
            would dress in draped white or cream garments to be auctioned off in a market-like setting,
            with the less desirable women assigned to “commoners.”

            “Bridal wear has become all about individual expression, with everything from caped-jumpsuits
            to matching suits being embraced as long as it makes the wearer feel like a star.”
